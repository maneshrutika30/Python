Problem:
The goal is to develop a Mutual Funds Investment Bucket that is optimized for long-term investments by balancing risk and returns. This involves selecting companies that provide consistent growth and moderate returns while minimizing exposure to volatility. Specifically, the objectives are:

1) Stock Selection: Identify stocks with high ROI and low volatility, which will form the core of the mutual funds portfolio.
2) Performance Evaluation: Use metrics such as volatility (standard deviation) and expected ROI to assess which stocks are optimal for inclusion in the portfolio.
3) Investment Strategy: Simulate the expected future value of investments based on monthly contributions over different time horizons (e.g., 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years).
4) Risk-Reward Balance: Develop a strategy that ensures a balance between risk and reward, targeting long-term investors who seek stable, compounded growth over several years.
